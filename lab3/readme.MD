## Laboratory Work 3 SlowLoris Attack:

# Tools used:
1. Slowloris (https://github.com/llaera/slowloris.pl)

# Steps:
1. Find a victim with limited resources and without protection from slowloris. In my case I chosen https://utm.md/.
2. Disable antivirus (because nobody can have that much power).
3. Clone the repository because chrome won't let you download it.
4. Start attacking site using perl slowloris.pl -dns https://utm.md/.
